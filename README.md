# A Hidden Markov Model exercise

This repository is an attempt to create a useable [Hidden Markov Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model) library,
based on the paper *A Revealing Introduction to Hidden Markov Models* by Dr. Mark Stamp of San Jose State University.

The paper can be downloaded [here](http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/~stamp/RUA/HMM.pdf).
